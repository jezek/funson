# Agent Guidelines

This project uses Go modules. When making changes:

- If you modify any Go files, format the changed code with `gofmt -w`.
- Run `go test ./...` only when Go code is updated and ensure it succeeds. Include the test output in the PR description.
- Keep commit messages concise.
- PR description should have a summary of changes and testing details.
